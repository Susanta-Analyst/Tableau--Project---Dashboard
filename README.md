The Tableau project has been executed by taking raw data from three files namely calendar.csv , listings.csv and reviews.csv ( Source Kaggle.com/airbnb/Seattle)

This project mostly focuses on the locationwise availability of rooms for rentals, year wise revenue earned from rentals and so on as per Airbnb data

The project has five visualisations carved out after cleaning the raw data from the above three files
